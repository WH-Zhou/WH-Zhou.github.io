Hello, welcome to my webpage! This is Wen-Han Zhou, a last year PhD student at observatoire de la CÃ´te d'Azur in Nice, France. I study the long-term evolution of asteroids under the thermal effects, namely YORP and Yarkovsky effect. I developed analytical,semi-analytical, and numerical models for the temperature distribution of small bodies. I also use n-body codes such as [rebound](https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)/[reboundx](https://reboundx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [pkdgrav]() to study the orbital and structural evolution of asteroids. 

 Short-term goal: to understand small body dynamics in the solar sytem and contribute to people's understanding of exoplanetary system based on our knowledge of solar system objects. 

 Long-term goal: to understand planetary formation and everthing in planetary science! 

 My research in 
 [Solar system objects](https://wh-zhou.github.io/solar_system): the Binary Yarkovsky effect, the Crater-induced YORP effect and long-term rotational evolution of main belt asteroids;
 [Extrasolar system objects](https://wh-zhou.github.io/extrasolar_system/): white dwarf pollution, interstellar objects.

I am excited to chat with experts from different fields and super welcome for collaborations.

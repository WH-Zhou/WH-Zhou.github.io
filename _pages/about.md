Hello, and welcome to my webpage! I am Wen-Han Zhou, a final-year Ph.D. student at the Observatoire de la CÃ´te d'Azur in Nice, France.


My Research
-----
 * [Solar system objects](https://wh-zhou.github.io/solar_system): The Binary Yarkovsky effect, the Crater-induced YORP effect, and the long-term evolution of binary asteroids and asteroid groups.

 * [Extrasolar system objects](https://wh-zhou.github.io/extrasolar_system/): White dwarf pollution, interstellar objects, debris disks.


 Tools
-----
* Thermal models of asteroids: Self-developed numerical, semi-analytical, analytical thermal models.

* N-body codes: [REBOUND](https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)/[REBOUNDX](https://reboundx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [PKDGRAV](https://www.astro.umd.edu/~dcr/research.html) to study the orbital and structural evolution of asteroids. 


Research Goals
------
* Short-term goal: Understand of small body dynamics within the solar system and apply this knowledge to improve our comprehension of exoplanetary systems.

* Long-term goal: Understand the planetary system evolution.


I am eager to chat with experts from different fields and welcome for collaborations!

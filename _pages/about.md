Hello, and welcome to my webpage! I am Wen-Han Zhou, a final-year Ph.D. student at the Observatoire de la CÃ´te d'Azur in Nice, France. My research focuses on the long-term evolution of asteroids influenced by thermal effects, specifically the YORP and Yarkovsky effects. I have developed analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical models to analyze the temperature distribution of small bodies. Additionally, I utilize N-body codes such as [rebound](https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)/[reboundx](https://reboundx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [pkdgrav]() to study the orbital and structural evolution of asteroids. 

Research Goals
------
 
* Short-term goal: to understand small body dynamics in the solar sytem and contribute to people's understanding of exoplanetary system based on our knowledge of solar system objects. 

* Long-term goal: to understand planetary formation and everthing in planetary science! 

My research
-----

 * [Solar system objects](https://wh-zhou.github.io/solar_system): the Binary Yarkovsky effect, the Crater-induced YORP effect and long-term rotational evolution of main belt asteroids;

 * [Extrasolar system objects](https://wh-zhou.github.io/extrasolar_system/): white dwarf pollution, interstellar objects.

I am excited to chat with experts from different fields and super welcome for collaborations.

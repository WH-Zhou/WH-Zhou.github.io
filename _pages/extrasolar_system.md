## White dwarf pollution ([Zhou et al. 2024](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2024/07/aa49271-24/aa49271-24.html))

White dwarfs are found to be contaminated by heavy elements, which are believed to originate from external sources such as planetary materials. However, most of polluted white dwarfs are found to be polluted by refractory materials, which is not consistent with the compositions of icy objects in the outer solar system.

We proposed that the volatile gas in the disk could be shielded by the magnetic field. In the process of orbital circularization, volatile content release from the surface and gas atoms are photoionized on a short timescale. The charged particles interact with the white dwarf magnetic field and are shielded from the corotation radius, where the spin period of white dwarf equals the Keplerian period.

## Crater-induced YORP (CYORP) effect ([Zhou et al. 2022](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2022/12/aa44386-22/aa44386-22.html); [Zhou & Michel 2024](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2024/02/aa46970-23/aa46970-23.html))

We developed a semi-analytical method to calculate the temperature distribution of a crater and the produced thermal torque, namely the CYORP torque. We found that roughly speaking, a crater with the size 1/3 of the asteroid could produce a CYORP torque comparable to the YORP torque. Based on this tool, we can estimate the YORP torque change brought by a sub-catastrophic impact, and study the asteroid rotational evolution under collisions and YORP.

  <figcaption>Evolution of the spin rate (left panel) and the obliquity (right panel) of a 10 km synthetic asteroid. In the presence of the static YORP torque (blue line), the asteroid gradually decelerates until it reaches a quasi-non-rotational state. Subsequently, we impose a new rotational state on the asteroid by assigning random values of rotational speed and obliquity. Conversely, when incorporating the CYORP torque (red line), the asteroid follows a different path, exhibiting random fluctuations in its spin rate due to the occurrence of impacts, creating new craters that lead to changes in the CYORP torque. As a result, the asteroid experiences intermittent transitions between spin up and spin down.</figcaption>

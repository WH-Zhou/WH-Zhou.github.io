## Binary Yarkovsky effect ([Zhou et al. 2024](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad4f7f))
-----
We discovered how the Yarkovsky effect affects the binary asteroids.

(1) The eclipse-induced thermal perturbation produces a net thermal force that moves the component towards the synchronous orbit where the spin period equals the orbital period.

(2) The radiation from the other component produces a net thermal force moves the component towards the opposite direction of the synchronous orbit.

For nearly co-planar binaries, for which the mutual orbit aligns with the heliocentric orbit, the (1) always dominates over (2). We propose this effect could account for the synchronization process of small binary asteroids in main belt asteroids and near Earth asteroids.

  <figcaption>We developed a semi-analytical method to calculate the temperature distribution of a crater and the produced thermal torque, namely the YORP torque. We found that roughly speaking, a crater with the size 1/3 of the asteroid could produce a CYORP torque comparable to the YORP torque. Based on this tool, we can estimate the YORP torque change brought by a sub-catastrophic impact</figcaption>

We found that roughly speaking, a crater with the size 1/3 of the asteroid could produce a CYORP torque comparable to the YORP torque. Based on this tool, we can estimate the YORP torque change brought by a sub-catastrophic impact, and study the asteroid rotational evolution under collisions and YORP.
